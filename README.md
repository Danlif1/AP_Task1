# AP_Task1

**This project was made by Daniel Lifshitz.**

In this task we needed to create a code that can get 2 vectors of ints and print their distance in 5 diffrenet ways:
1) Euclidian distance
2) Manhattan distance
3) Chebyshev distance
4) Canberra distance
5) Minkowski distance

The way I did it was by creating 3 files.
The first file is called ex1 is the main file which runs the main function.
The second file is getVector this file handles the input and has two functions:
The first function gets the line of the vector (meaning it read the entire line and inputs it into a single string)
The second function cuts the line into different integers and puts them inside the vectors
